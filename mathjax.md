title: Fomulas with MathJax
---

Do we support mathjax on dxi.ai?

$$

\sum_{i=1}^{n}{foo_n}

$$

The original theme does not support markdown. We integrated support for latex Formulas into our DxI.ai Theme. While mathJax is supported, it needs some fixing to get the layout correct. right now the css seems to interfere with lowered indeces and markup. 

There is a really stupid bug in Safari, that hinders safari from rendering Fomulas at screen sizes of iPad. 

### Moodle Support

Moodle supports inline mathJax with diverting markers. We needs to find out if we can configure this for our pages, so we can exchange the code with Moodle more easily.

### Jupyter Lab Support 

Jupyer Lab uses a vanilla coniguration of MathJax. Which is nice, so all code will just work.
