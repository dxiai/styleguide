A teaser text can be included at the top. 

# This is an ordinary page

This page should have a header but no hero information

I wonder if a force deployment is possible. This pages is supposed to be almost empty. ventually we should have some information by now. I wonder what the problem is. and why this deployment takes so long.

This page should get immediately updated. More or less at least

It seems that some information has been restricted from a sass bug. Stupidly pg paged did not report such error. 

The following chunk checks the different types of links and information that we have in our Moodle content, so we can move it into github as soon as we can. 

- Alerts are used to highlight sections of contents, where primary stands for definitions, info general highlights, warning potential elements of errors, danger points to misuse. Success stands for best practices. 

- Buttons are used for linking resources. Success means other pages, primary means data. The file icon indicates an internal link, the download icon is used with data, and the link, or export icon is used with external links.

<p class="alert alert-warning">hello warning</p>

<p class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-file-o"></i> This should be a button</p>

I wonder whether the error appears in the class definition of the html code above.

The problem was in the theme. if the theme is not ok then deployments will not work.
