## Introduction

This should be a bulma style page... not sure why it does not show.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dxiai/tmppages.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

[link other page](other_index.md){: .btn.btn-primary}

add some more information.{: .alert.alert-warning}

This page is a markdown tutorial, because we need it for testing. It happens that sometimes a deployment runs too fast after a theme release.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

> A simple quote

<p class="notification is-primary"> a quote as a warning. This would be awesome. This is not really working for us :( This quote *should* be handled correctly</p>

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dxiai/tmppages.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
