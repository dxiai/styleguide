## Introduction

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dxiai/tmppages.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. However, this theme does not use github markdown, but a variant that has some quirks. For the most part this is not really a problem, because these quirks are closer (but not exactly compliant) to Moodle's markdown version. This is probably the major drawback that markdown is not standardise but labels loosely a bunch of formatting rules that are bend and broken across implementations. Yet it is much simpler than typing plain HTML because what I need is too complicated for many WYSIWYG editors.

This style guide provides an overview on the perks of the different dialects that we use in our team.

- github flavoured markdown
- Moodle Markdown 
- Jupyter Markdown 
- "Jekyll" Markdown (karmadown)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Web-pages are more complex than normal documentation on github, there are a few tweaks available: 

[Alerts and Buttons](alerts.md){: .btn.btn-primary}

[Formula](mathjax.md){: .btn.btn-primary}

[Blogs and Pages](blogs.md){: .btn.btn-primary}

[Automation](automation.md){: .btn.btn-primary}

[Code Fragments](code.md){: .btn.btn-primary}

This page is a markdown tutorial, because we need it for testing. It happens that sometimes a deployment runs too fast after a theme release.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

> A simple quote, which does not work in moodle.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dxiai/tmppages.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
